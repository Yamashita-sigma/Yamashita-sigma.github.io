## Research Focus

My research focuses on ultra-high contrast imaging in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). STEM enables the visualization of fine structures in materials with atomic resolution and is widely used in materials science and device development. However, when observing light element materials, there is a problem that the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the STEM image decrease significantly because we need to observe the sample under extremely low dose condition to avoid the electron beam damage. Optimum Bright Field (OBF) STEM technique is a new method, developed in our laboratory recently, that enables the observation of light elements with high contrast using segmented or pixelated detectors. I am researching the development of more efficient segmented detetors and the atomic-resolution observation of electron beam-sensitive materials using these detectors.
